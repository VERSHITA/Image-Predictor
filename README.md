# Image-Predictor
I have created a webpage, where we could upload an image (Bird, Plane, Car) and the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model will predict what the image is.

-To run the application, open the 'app.ipynb' python file and run. 
-After its successfull running, you will find a blue url (port 5000). 
-Click on the url and run the page. 
-It will run on the local server. 
-The html-css file will be picked from the templates folder 
-Now you can choose an image from your device and upload it to see the prediction. 
-Your image will be saved in the static folder

*Total images: 1800:- Train images: 1500 -Train (Bird) images: 500 -Train (Car) images: 500 -Train (Plane) images: 500

Test images: 300 -Test (Bird) images: 100 -Test (Car) images: 100 -Test (Plane) images: 100

Here the demonstration:
